    <p>I would like to one day visit Johannesburg. I have always wondered how life would be in another province. The city of gold is South Africa's biggest city.It is also one the most exiting cities with fun things to do like bungee jumping off the soweto cooling towers, most celebritites  reside in jozi.And also because one of my  favourite music genres,kwaito music, a catchy genre of African house music that was born in the 90s and has become a South African phenomenon. It is most famous for its catchy lyrics that embody post-apartheid township culture. I want to experience a different culture lifestyle besides the capetonian one.

The many names of the building over three centuries – Slave Lodge, Government Offices Building, Old Supreme Court, and SA Cultural History Museum – reflect the long and rich history of the building.In 1998 this museum was renamed the Slave Lodge.</p>

<p><strong>The greenmarket Square</strong> was created in 1678 and it is the second oldest public site in Cape Town (after the Grand Parade). ... When Cape Town was granted its own municipal administration in 1840, the building became the first City Hall. The square itself was originally used as a slave market and as a market for fruit and vegetables.
